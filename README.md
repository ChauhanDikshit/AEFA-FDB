## 🔋 Overview

**Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD)** is essential for maintaining power system reliability, particularly in modern grids with high **renewable energy penetration**. This repository presents **AEFA-FDB**, a metaheuristic algorithm that integrates physical principles and learning strategies to solve the **stochastic ORPD problem** efficiently.

AEFA-FDB is enhanced with:
- A **Fitness Distance-Based (FDB) learning** mechanism
- **Historical data utilization** for improved adaptability
- A **nonlinear adaptive weight strategy** for exploration-exploitation trade-off
- **Monte Carlo simulations** to model uncertainties from **solar PV**, **wind**, and **hydropower**
